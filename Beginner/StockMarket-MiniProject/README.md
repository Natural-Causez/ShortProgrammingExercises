Mini-project

Simulates basic portfolio of buying and selling shares in a pre-defined ArrayList

Note:
Search box and buy/sell prices not functional

Essentially initialises GUI and builds JListBoxes with pre-defined strings and JButtons to move strings to and forth.
Drop-down menu to switch between markets while retaining portfolio data also functional.
